# TrimpConnect
TrimpConnect is a web platform that helps students share daily rides to college. Drivers offer seats to students in the same city or route. Passengers search for rides and request to join, while drivers approve based on availability. This system reduces costs, supports eco-friendly travel, and improves student convenience.
